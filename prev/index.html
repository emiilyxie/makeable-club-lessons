        you can give each HTML tag two attributes:
        id=""
        class=""

        id means "identifier." all ids are unique. if you give
        an HTML tag an id, any reference to that id will point
        to that exact HTML tag
     -->
     <p id="paragraph-one">Hello, this is paragraph one.</p>

     <!--
         class is like an id, but it can apply to more than one
         HTML tag. any reference to that class will point to all
         the HTML tags associated with it

         these are not referenced yet. we will use the CSS file
         to reference them and add definitions. go to the head.

        I like riding bicycles. Here's a link about bicycles:
        bicycle link
        <!-- the "enter" will not show -->
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's try again:<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle">Bicycle Wikipedia</a>
        <!-- 
            href = hyperreference (basically a link)
            <a> tag has the href attribute
            attributes tell more about tags
            key="value"
        -->
    </p>

    <h2>Reasons why bicycles are cool</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>they are <i>fast</i></li>
        <li>you can get them in any color</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>they are eco-friendly</li>
    </ul>
