NOTES
- line 5: make sure there is a space between the rel and href, for instance
rel="stylesheet" [space] href="style.css"
- lines 9-41: for everything within the body, i.e within <body> and </body>,
try to give them an indent as a visual cue (you can use tab) 
- lines 15-27: there are several ways to add styling to an html page. one is
through the CSS file, and another way is with the style="" attribute. for these
lines, I've noticed that you've been using the style="" attribute, which works!
just keep in mind that anything you set in the style attribute will override
whatever is indicated in the CSS file.
In general, I recommend using the CSS file to do styling, as it keeps all your
styles in one neat little place.
- line 36: remember to close the img tag!
- line 37: you probably don't need the <head> tag here
- line 38: if you would like to add the gummybear id here, this is the place to do
so. just add the id="gummybear-picture" & you're good
