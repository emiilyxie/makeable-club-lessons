            <h1 class="title">What is bubble tea?</h1>
            <p class="m">Bubble tea is a drink typically made with milk tea and chewy tapioca pearls. Bubble tea may also have different additions, such as pudding, grass jelly, or agar pearls. The milk tea itself may also be different flavors or a different beverage. Bubble tea can be found at a number of local bubble tea shops or made at home. At bubble tea shops, it is common to be able to select different levels of sweetness or different temperatures.</p>

            <h1 class="title">The history of bubble tea</h1>
            <p class="m">Bubble tea originated in Taiwan in the 1980s. The idea of putting the tapioca pearls into milk tea goes to either Chun Shui Tang Teahouse in Taizhong or Hanlin Teahouse in Tainan. The taopica balls originally used in Hanlin Teahouse were white, bearing more resemblance to pearls, but were eventually switched out for the black pearls more commonly seen today. Since then, bubble tea has gained traction among other tea shops and in different countries. It has also gained a more diverse range of flavors and toppings/additives.</p>
