NOTES:

line 1: be sure to put an exclamation in that line, like <!DOCTYPE html>
line 2: because this text is not in the body or not in the title of 
    the head, it will not show up anywhere
line 4: I don't think that <word> is a valid tag in HTML. If I
    remember correctly, I was using <word> as an example of how
    tags should be formatted. You can delete this.
line 7: after this line, close the head by putting a </head>
line 11: a little nitpicky of me, but you probably don't need to 
    capitalize the H's
line 13: this paragraph doesn't have any text in it. If you would like to 
    a return/enter space, you can use the <br> tag!
line 16: be sure to close the <p> tag at the end. I think you meant to
    to this, but the ending tag ended up on line 19.
line 21, 23: because the content in your webpage is not completed yet,
    you do not want to end or start the body at this point. all the
    content in your page should be within the body.
line 27-28: this type of code should be within the CSS file
line 31: the "class" attribute of the h3 should be within the starting tag,
    i.e. <h3 class="red-text">. additionally, there should be a hypen
    in "red-text", otherwise the code will think you are talking about
    several different classes (a "red" class and a "text" class). Lastly,
    remember to put quotes at the end of text to close the name of the class
line 32: this line of code should be in the head, not the body
line 34-37: this is also code that is better suited for the CSS file
line 39-47: this is also more for the CSS file. for some of them, remember
    to add the semicolon at the end! also, in line 47 there should be 
    a hypen between text and decoration, so like text-decoration
line 51: close the html file w a </html>

I guess some concepts I might've not emphasized too deeply are that
1) HTML is the file that has a lot of <>. It is meant to provide structure and
    content to your webpage.
2) CSS is the file that has a lot of #, ., and {}. It is meant to add
    cool styles to your webpage.

    If you are comfortable with the difference between these, then I think
    you'll start to get the hang of coding between these to files to develop 
    your website!

also...

1) the head of the HTML stores important information, like the title of
    the webpage and what CSS files it will use, but no actual content of the
    page is written in the head.
2) the body of the HTML has all the content -- the headers, text, images, links, etc

last thing good job with the indentation! It's a little hard to get used to, 
but most of the things in your code are indented nicely :)
