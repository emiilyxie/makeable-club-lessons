NOTES
- line 4 & 5: since the title and link are within the head,
try to give them an indent as a visual cue (you can use tab)
- line 8: this line is good, but following the indentation from
before, everything within the body should be indented
- line 9: the tag is <h1> (H one), not <hl> (H L). yeah they look
pretty similar ngl
- line 12: class is an attribute. it should be within the starting
<h2> tag
- line 16: I found a new picture :)
- line 17: you can delete the <head> here, it doesn't serve much purpose
because you are not starting or ending the head at this place
- lines 20-23: make sure you are not closing your starting tags before
you place your attribute -- the > should envelop the entire attribute
- line 24: you can end the body here, since there are no other HTML elements
after this point
- lines 25-27: you can delete this. we have already linked the style.css
in the head, and the code after that should belong in the CSS file 
(not the HTML file)
